A set of qc files to aid in the creation of Left 4 Dead 2 character replacers. Designed to be easy to read and have and drop-in functionality. Compiled result is not 100% authentic to what's seen in Left 4 Dead 2, but it is very close. Biggest differences are in LOD meshes and eyelid parameters.

This was made because the starter kit found in the developer tools contain inaccuracies or errors, and because simply decompiling a model will make it difficult to parse. These are a hybrid of both with some human intervention to make it easier to read, courtesy of HedyL
